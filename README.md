# Concurrent Resource Allocation Simulation

A Java-based simulation of concurrent resource allocation modeled after the classic Dining Philosophers problem.  
Implements multithreading and synchronization mechanisms (using Threads and Semaphores) to prevent deadlock and starvation.

## Features
- Thread-based concurrency with shared resource management  
- Deadlock prevention using ordered resource acquisition  
- Console logging for state transitions (thinking, eating, waiting)  

## Technologies
- Java (Threads, Semaphores)
